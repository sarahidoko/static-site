    <p>A batch of freshly made chocolate chip cookies will beat a pack of shop-bought any day. Just cream the butter and sugar, chuck in the rest of the ingredients and mix – it really is that simple. You can get the kids to help you make them too. It’s a good idea to make up a big batch of cookie dough, wrap in cling-film and freeze – then bake up a batch of cookies whenever you fancy them.
